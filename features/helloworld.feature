Feature: Awesome Developers Do Awesome Things
  As a Developer
  I want to use CucumberJS
  So everything thinks I am teh awesome!

Scenario: Awesome Developer Can Print out 'Hello World!'
  Given I have setup my development space correctly
  When I compile and run tests
  Then I see the expected default message from loaded main module
